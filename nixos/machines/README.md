# nixos per-machine configs

the machine's `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` should import
`machines/<HOSTNAME>.nix`, like so:

```nix
# Edit this configuration file to define what should be installed on
# your system.  Help is available in the configuration.nix(5) man page
# and in the NixOS manual (accessible by running ‘nixos-help’).
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      # Per-machine configs
      /home/eliza/dotfiles/nixos/machines/noctis.nix
    ];
    
  # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
  # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
  # on your system were taken. It‘s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
  # this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
  # Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
  # (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
  system.stateVersion = "20.03"; # Did you read the comment?
}
```
